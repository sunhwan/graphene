# graphene sheet generator

This package generates a graphene sheets with (or without?) defects. A defect refers non-hexagonal, e.g., five- or seven-carbon graphene unit. The defects are introduced under a assumption of:

- carbons in the non-hexagonal graphene unit are still in sp2 configuration.
- non-hexagonal graphene units are not adjacent each other.
